        <!--The word "controls" ensures that you have the play button, that line that indicates where the video has reached etc. If you don't add it, your video will appear like a picture, you won't be able to click play-->
        <!--I've set the width to be the same as the wrapper-->
        <!--If you want it to autoplay, you add autoplay and muted. If you put autoplay alone, it doesn't work. The developers of html:5 didn't want you to scare people when they load your website so that's why you have to put them together for them to work-->
        <!--I've removed autoplay rn cz I wanted to show how a poster works but plz note that you put it within the first set of video brackets, where you put controls, muted etc-->
        <!--If you just want it to automatically be muted, add muted only and the user starts playing it, it will be muted until she presses play-->
        <!--loop is self-explanatory-->
        <!--poster is the picture you want to appear before your video starts playing. You'll notice that it's bigger than the video. I've asked chat and it says that you can't target the poster however, the solution is manually sizing the poster then placing it here. Or you can place a div before the first video tag and place a background image there, you'll use position absolute and relative to make it appear on top of the video, then use javascript to change the opacity to 0 before the video starts to play. I'll demonstrate this with a second video below-->
        <br>
        <button onclick="playPause()">Play/Pause</button>
        <button onclick="halfSize()">Half size</button>
        <button onclick="normalSize()">Normal size</button>

        <!--Making a text have the javascript effect-->
        <h2 onclick="playPause()" style="cursor:pointer;">This plays or pauses the video</h2>
